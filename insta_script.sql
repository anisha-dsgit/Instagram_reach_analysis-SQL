3.	What is the engagement rate per follower ? 
               (ikes+comments/total followers * 100)
4.	Find the minimum number of hashtags used by any user.
5.	Find the photo with maximum comments.
		a.	Does the photo have maximum likes also?

		c.	who does this photo belong to?
		d.	Is the user popular ?
		e.	Are the hashtags used popular ones? 
6.	Find the tags which attract maximum likes. 
(here we are calculating hashtags with high engagement)
7.	Find the percentage of active and inactive followers per user id.
8.	Find the popular time of active followers. (time is not different in this dataset ) 
9.	Do all the followers like all the photos of followee? - are they bots or not? 
10.	Find users using popular tags on their photos. 
(Are they having following among the top 10% of the users? )
